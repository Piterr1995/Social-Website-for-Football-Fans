# Full Social Website for Football Fans
This is a social network build with Django, HTML5/CSS3 + CSS Grid (responsive), jQuery, AJAX, PostgreSQL and Python for football fans.

A visitor can create a new account, add his own posts with CKEditor, which will be reviewed by the admin or moderator before going public.
Users can comment posts and like other comments or/and comment replies.


To use it, you will need to create your own settings.py file (I don't want the data to be displayed here), add your own database, create some posts in admin panel and upload some images for website to be working.
